									The taxi arrived on time, and drove us to the airport. We did get into a wrong taxi first. Then realized it was not the one we had ordered. He was not a happy camper when he had to back up. 

When the right driver showed up, he had my name. Maybe a note on your bookings to say that the driver will address you by name would avoid this from happening to others.
